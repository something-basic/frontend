## Project Pitch

## Brainstorm

- Cocktail recipe idea: backup
- Gmail analytics: primary idea
- Demographics survey
- Directions to transit stations
- Something to do with NASA satellite/asteroid tracking, weather, digital telescope, mars rover tracking
- Store a collection of things that the user likes
- ???

### Summary of idea

- An application that gives users insights into the analytics of their gmail emails. Visualizations on messages left unread and who the messages are from over time. 

### What problem or pain point does it solve?

- Intent is to see if there is progress in not leaving messages unread.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition

- User login
- Chart that shows unread messages by day.
- Chart that shows proportion of unread messages by day.
- Chart that shows a breakdown of who the messages are from, past X days
- Only if a database is needed: store preferences for what data to show (ie: show data for past X days, axis scaling, etc).
